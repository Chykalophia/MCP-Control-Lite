# MCP Manager - Project Plan

## Project Overview

A unified MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configuration manager for macOS that addresses the pain point of managing MCP configurations across various applications, plugins, and CLI tools. The application will provide both graphical and command-line interfaces for easy MCP server management.

## Tech Stack Options

### Option 1: Tauri (Rust + Web Frontend) - **RECOMMENDED**

**Pros:**
- Single codebase for both GUI and CLI
- Native macOS performance
- Small bundle size (~10-15MB)
- Built-in auto-updater
- Strong security model
- Can easily package as .app and CLI binary

**Cons:**
- Learning curve if new to Rust
- Smaller ecosystem than Electron

### Option 2: Electron + Node.js

**Pros:**
- Familiar web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Huge ecosystem
- Easy to prototype quickly
- Can share logic between GUI and CLI

**Cons:**
- Larger bundle size (~100MB+)
- Higher memory usage
- Less "native" feel

### Option 3: Go + Fyne/Wails

**Pros:**
- Single binary distribution
- Good performance
- Easy cross-platform builds
- Simple CLI integration

**Cons:**
- Less polished UI frameworks
- Smaller community for GUI development

## Architecture Components

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install Node.js (for frontend)
brew install node

# Install Tauri CLI
cargo install tauri-cli
```

~/.continue/config.json
# Custom locations for other tools
```

## CLI Design Example

```bash
# List all MCP servers
mcp-manager list

# Add a new server
mcp-manager add --name "filesystem" --command "npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem" --args "/Users/username/Documents"

# Enable server for specific app
mcp-manager enable filesystem --app claude

# Sync configurations across apps

# Browse available servers
mcp-manager browse --category "development"
```

## Key Features

### Configuration Management
- Unified view of all MCP servers across applications
- Easy enable/disable toggles
- Configuration validation and error checking
- Backup and restore capabilities

### Server Discovery
- Browse available MCP servers from various sources
- Integration with package managers (npm, pip, etc.)
- Custom server addition with validation
- Server categorization and tagging

### Application Integration
- Auto-detect supported applications
- Application-specific configuration handling
- Sync settings across multiple apps
- Per-app server management

### User Experience
- Intuitive GUI with drag-and-drop functionality
- Comprehensive CLI for automation
- Real-time status indicators
- Configuration conflict resolution

## Distribution Strategy

### Mac App Store Compatibility

**Possible but with significant constraints:**

**Requirements:**
- Must be code-signed with Apple Developer Program certificate ($99/year)
- Must pass App Store review process
- Must comply with App Store guidelines
- Requires app sandboxing (major challenge for file access)

**Key Challenges:**
1. **Sandboxing Restrictions**
   - Limited file system access (major issue for MCP config management)
   - Can't access arbitrary user files without explicit permission
   - Network restrictions may affect server discovery
   - Can't execute external binaries easily

2. **Configuration File Access**
   - App would need user permission to access MCP config locations
   - Users would need to grant access via file picker dialogs for each config

### Recommended Distribution Methods

**For MCP Manager, direct distribution is recommended:**

1. **Direct Distribution (.dmg/.pkg)**
   - No sandboxing restrictions
   - Full file system access
   - Can execute external commands
   - Easier to implement MCP server management

2. **Homebrew Distribution**
   ```bash
   brew install --cask mcp-manager
   ```

3. **GitHub Releases**
   - Automatic updates via Tauri's updater
   - Easy CI/CD with GitHub Actions

4. **Notarization (Recommended)**
   - Code sign and notarize for macOS Gatekeeper
   - Users won't see security warnings
   - No sandboxing restrictions
   - Still requires Apple Developer Program

### Tauri Configuration Examples

**For Direct Distribution (Recommended):**
```json
// tauri.conf.json
{
  "tauri": {
    "bundle": {
      "macOS": {
        "signingIdentity": "Developer ID Application: Your Name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Professional Distribution Features:**
- Code signing and notarization
- Automatic updates
- Clean installer (.dmg or .pkg)
- Homebrew distribution for CLI users
- No permission dialogs for config file access

## Next Steps

1. Choose technology stack (recommend Tauri)
2. Set up development environment
3. Create basic project structure
4. Implement configuration file parsing
5. Build MVP CLI interface
6. Develop basic GUI
7. Add server discovery features
8. Implement application integration
9. Set up code signing and distribution pipeline
10. Add advanced features and polish

- Performance issues with large configs → Optimize parsing and caching

**Market Risks:**
- Competing tools emerge → Maintain first-mover advantage through superior UX
- MCP adoption slows → Expand to other AI assistant protocols
- Platform restrictions → Ensure compliance with macOS guidelines

**Execution Risks:**
- Feature creep delaying launch → Strict MVP scope, post-launch iterations
- Poor user feedback → Early beta testing, responsive development
- Distribution challenges → Multiple channels, community-driven growth

## Notes

- Focus on macOS initially, but keep cross-platform compatibility in mind
- Prioritize user experience and ease of use
- Ensure robust error handling and validation
- Consider security implications of configuration management
- Plan for future extensibility and plugin architecture
