# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement File System Operations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a file system service to handle reading, writing, and monitoring configuration files across different applications.
# Details:
Successfully implemented a comprehensive file system operations module with the following components:

### 1. ConfigFileService (config.rs)
- **Multi-format support**: JSON, YAML, TOML configuration files
- **Atomic operations**: Safe file writes with temporary files and atomic moves
- **Backup integration**: Automatic backup creation before modifications
- **Operation tracking**: Complete audit trail with hashes and timestamps
- **Validation**: Format validation and metadata extraction
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all file operations

### 2. ConfigWatcher (watcher.rs)
- **File monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of configuration file changes
- **Event types**: Created, Modified, Deleted, Renamed events
- **Polling-based**: Configurable polling interval for cross-platform compatibility
- **Multi-file support**: Watch multiple files simultaneously
- **Hash verification**: File integrity checking with SHA-256 hashes
- **Thread-safe**: Safe concurrent access with proper synchronization

### 3. BackupService (backup.rs)
- **Automated backups**: Automatic backup creation with metadata
- **Backup types**: Support for Automatic, Manual, Scheduled, PreUpdate backups
- **Retention policies**: Configurable retention periods and cleanup
- **Integrity verification**: SHA-256 hash verification for backup integrity
- **Compression ready**: Framework for future compression support
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive backup statistics and reporting

### 4. PathResolver (paths.rs)
- **Application detection**: Automatic detection of Claude Desktop, Cursor, Zed, VS Code
- **Cross-platform paths**: Platform-specific configuration path resolution
- **Installation detection**: Automatic detection of installed applications
- **Path utilities**: Safe path operations with directory traversal protection
- **Caching**: Efficient path caching for performance

# Test Strategy:
1. Comprehensive test suite with 19 tests covering all major functionality
2. Cross-platform compatibility testing
3. Error handling validation for edge cases
4. Memory safety ensured through Rust's type system
5. Integration tests with temporary files and directories
6. File integrity verification tests
7. Thread safety and concurrency tests
8. Performance testing for path resolution caching
9. Backup and restore functionality validation
10. Format detection and parsing tests for JSON, YAML, and TOML
